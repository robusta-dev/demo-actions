We want Kubernetes maintenance to be simpler.

We want to share knowledge about Kubernetes troubleshooting.

Robusta lets us do all of that with one simple Python function per scenario.

# Is it really that simple?

All the wiring and annoying parts are handled by Robusta. 
The action contains logic but no boilerplate wiring.
