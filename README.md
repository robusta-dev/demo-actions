# Introduction
Demo automations using [Robusta](https://github.com/robusta-dev/robusta)

1. List resource manifests by kind
2. List pods by status

More to come soon!

# Why another automation tool
Because we love Python.

We want Kubernetes maintenance to be simpler.

We want to share knowledge about Kubernetes troubleshooting.

Robusta lets us do all of that with one simple Python function per scenario.

# Is it really that simple?
Yes! 

All the wiring and annoying parts are handled by Robusta. 
The action contains logic but no boilerplate wiring.

[See the Robusta docs on manual triggers to understand how this works.](https://docs.robusta.dev/master/playbook-reference/triggers/manual-triggers.html)
